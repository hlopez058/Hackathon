# Unit Tests

Unit Tests are tests we can run when troubleshooting hardware and software components. This will increase our efficiency when identifying what is broken during the hackathon. I have listed a few tests that we can get started developing and testing with the software. We should eventually create more once we get more of our software developed.
 
## Basic HW Unit Tests :
1. Servo - (move it)
2. Speaker - (play a test.wav sound)
3. Microphone - (pick up noise and play back sound)
4. Led - ( on/off led with different colors)
5. Camera - (take an image and save the file) 
 
## Basic SW Unit Tests :
1. Connect to Watson  (check internet conn. with api services)
2. S-to-Text Service (microphone output to console output) 
3. Text-to-S Service (audio outputs "Hello World")
4. Test Chatbot Service (send "Hello" get back "Hello Im TjBot")
5. FileIO ( write out a file with "Hello World" , read the file to console output)
